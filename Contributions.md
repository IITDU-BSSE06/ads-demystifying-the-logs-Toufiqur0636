I have taken help from some websites and some of the classmates. I have searched for the concepts and way of solution in some websites. Among them, some are worth mentioning. The links of the websites I have used are given below:

Among them from whom I have clarfied the concept, first of all I should be grateful to Feroze Ahmed (BSSE - 0618). I have discussed with him several times about understanding the problems and finding out the way of solutions. Besides I have discussed with A.S.M. Khairul Alam (BSSE - 0612), Ali Zafar Sadiq (BSSE - 0603), Tanvir Ahmed Siddiqi (BSSE - 0639) and Md. Zulfikar Rahman(BSSE - 0640) sometimes.
